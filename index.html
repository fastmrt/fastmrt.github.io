        <h2>Our Research</h2>
        <p>At FastMRT, we are working on developing new machine learning algorithms and hardware solutions to improve
          the speed and quality of MRI scans for thermometery. Our research focuses on three main areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Image Reconstruction:</strong> We are developing new algorithms to reconstruct high-quality images
            from undersampled MRI data. By reducing the amount of data needed for each scan, we can make MRI scans
            faster without sacrificing image quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Hardware Acceleration:</strong> We are exploring new hardware solutions to accelerate MRI scans.
            By optimizing the hardware used in MRI machines, we can reduce scan times and improve patient throughput.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Validation and Clinical Translation:</strong> We are working with clinical partners to validate
            our methods and ensure that they are safe and effective for patients. We are also exploring ways to
            integrate our methods into clinical workflows to improve patient outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
